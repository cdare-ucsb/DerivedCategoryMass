    Main class for line bundles on a projective variety. Line bundles are specifically locally free

    resolution by line bundles (coming from the `canonical' exceptional collection). However, on K3 
    surfaces, it is not generally true that even vector bundles can be decomposed into sums of line
    bundels.

    Since LineBundles are specifically rank 1, their second chern class c_2(L) always vanishes. Since
    the second Chern Character is (c_1^2(E) - c_2(E))/2, the second Chern Character of a line bundle
