    Generic class for coherent sheaves on a projective variety. This class is

    numerical stability conditions technicially only depend on the Chern
    Character. 

    The parent class to this is DerivedCategoryObject, which is a more general

    a string label.

class LineBundle(CoherentSheaf):
    r"""!
    Main class for line bundles on a projective variety. Line bundles are specifically locally free
    sheaves (i.e. vector bundles) of rank 1. In the cases of Local P1 and Local P2, the line bundles
    will serve as the building blocks of the derived category, since every coherent sheaf admits a 
    resolution by line bundles (coming from the `canonical' exceptional collection). However, on K3 
    surfaces, it is not generally true that even vector bundles can be decomposed into sums of line
    bundels.

    Since LineBundles are specifically rank 1, their second chern class c_2(L) always vanishes. Since
    the second Chern Character is (c_1^2(E) - c_2(E))/2, the second Chern Character of a line bundle
    is simply c_1^2(E)/2; therefore, this class will conveniently only store the degree of the line
    bundle, which is the first Chern Character.
