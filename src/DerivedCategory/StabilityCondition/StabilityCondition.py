    #     This method is the main workhorse of the SphericalTwist class. It computes the Harder-Narasimhan factors
    #     of the spherical twist object. It is generally assumed that for a single spherical twist, the only way
    #     that an object can destabilize is when an element of the last term of the defining triangle

    #                          O(a) -----> Tw_O(a) O(b) -------->  O(b)[n] âŠ• O(b)[n+1]

    #     has larger phase than O(a). In this case, the Harder-Narasimhan factors of the spherical twist depend on 
    #     which object it is that has larger phase. For example, if the minimum shift has larger phase, then we assume
    #     that the object must be strictly stable - THIS IS A CONJECTURE. If the maximum shift has smaller phase, then
    #     the triangle above leads to a Harder-Narasimhan filtration, so that the individual line bundle sums are precisely
    #     the HN factors; this is a result of Bapat-Deopurkar-Licata (2020).
         
    #     The most difficult case is when the smaller phase O(b)[n] is smaller than O(a) is smaller than O(b)[n+1]. In this 
    #     case, some homological algebra is required to show that the cone of the composed map 

    #                           Tw_O(a) O(b) -------> O(b)[n+1]

    #     fits into a distinguished triangle O(a) ----> Cone ----> O(b)[n]. 

    #     Instead of returning the objects alone, the method returns a list of tuples, where the first element is the semistable
    #     factor and the second element is the phase of the object. This is done to make computing largest and smallest semistable
    #     factors easier in the DoubleSphericalTwist class.

    #     The list is always returned in reverse order of the phase, so that the smallest phase HN factor is last and the largest
    #     is first.
