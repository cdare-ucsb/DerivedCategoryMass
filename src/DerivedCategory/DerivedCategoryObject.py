class DerivedCategoryObject(ABC):
    r"""!
    This class acts as a general parent class for objects in the derived category of coherent sheaves.
    The derived category is a triangulated category (though in many cases is a dg-category) that is
    constructed over an abelian category --- in geometric contexts, this is usually the category of
    coherent sheaves on a variety. The derived category is a way to encode the information of the
    homological data of the abelian category in a more structured way, though it is considerably abstract
    since an element of the derived complex technically represents all possible resolutions of the object.

    One can typically think of objects in the derived catagory as chain complexes of sheaves; however, it
    will be true in general that multiple chain complexes of varying lengths can represent the same object
    in the derived category. For example, one can consider the cotangent bundle 立^1 on a variety IP^2; there
    is a minimal resolution of the cotangent bundle by:

                               0 -> O(-3) -> O(-2)^3 -> 立^1 -> 0

    obtained by replacing the last two terms in the standard Koszul resolution by 立^1 = ker(O(-1)^3 --> O). It then
    follows that the derived category object representing 立^1 is the same as the two-term complex O(-3) -> O(-2)^3. 


    As this is the most general class used in the current program, it will assume the least amount of information
    given since we can only assume the object fits into at least one distinguished triangle which may help
    determine the objects Chern character / numerical data. Thus, the bare minimum information this
    should encode is the catagory of the object and a string representation of the object.
